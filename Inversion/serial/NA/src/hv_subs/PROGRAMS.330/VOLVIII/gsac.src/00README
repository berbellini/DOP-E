27 MAR 2004 - start

-------

11 APR 2004  -- implemented single pole LP and HP
	Note for the CCM of the Mar 17 earthquake
	both CLM and CCM are noise

	We need a taper

12 APR 2004  - LP and HP implemented - now put in
	BP and BR

	start to work on LH subset

	Then start CH

	Finally WH

	WSAC

****************PUT IN FOOLPROOF CHECKS FOR FORNER FREQUENCIES only
	known when actually filter when trace is known

16 APR 2004 lh is ok except must identify columns 1 or 2 can do this
	in mode of the DEFAULT e.g. negative id but expects integer
	simple

	ch started - works with real and integer
	must add in character enumerated logical
	to set ch boeaftn gmt .....  we must permit something special
	or just have a gmt command - but we do not know O
	KEVNM  is 16 characters long so this is a special command??
		to be added

	SETFHV  - float
	SETIHV  - enumerated
	SETKHV  - string
	SETLHV  - logical
	SETNHV  - integer
       C:              void setfhv( kname, fvalue, nerr, kname_s )
       C:              void setihv( kname, kvalue, nerr, kname_s, kvalue_s )
       C:              void setkhv(kname, kvalue, nerr, kname_s, kvalue_s)

22 APR for perplot if we are at the last one and cannot draw a comple page, 
test and put in the scale else we have

-------------

03 MAY 2004  - MUST STILL DO ANALOG -> DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

	ALSO CALPLOT DRIVER must 
	a) output nothing for initialization
	b) must eliminate buttons

	FOR CH is any of the coordinates change, recompute the
	distance 

-----
08 MAY 2004 LHDR done  must fill in error help Beijing

	WRITE HEADER DONE

	WRITE DONE for overwrite but not for a rename
------
11 MAY 2004 COLOR implemented Beijing

------
12 MAY 2004 FUNCGEN implemented for an impulse only Beijing

------
14 MAY 2004 Seoul
	BESSEL filters now work as well as BUTTERWORTH

-----
16 MAY 2004 - Incheon Airport
	CUTERR implemented
	CUT works and sets up the arrays

	gsac_control.cutint[2] and gsac_control.cutoff[2]

	In the routine read, we will do the following:

* start = MIN(sacdata[k].sachdr.rhdr[CUT_INT1] + offset1,
 *              sacdata[k].sachdr.rhdr[CUT_INT2] + offset2)
 *  end  = MAX(sacdata[k].sachdr.rhdr[CUT_INT1] + offset1,
 *              sacdata[k].sachdr.rhdr[CUT_INT2] + offset2)

	this will permit something like
		o 20 o -10 to be the same as o -10 o 20

	put this in the documentation

	The read routine must now be constructed to 
		read the data, then to either cut or fill Z after the
		read, e.g., the time at which we know the header
		values

	TODO finalize
		INTERPOLATE
		TRANSFER
			also upgrade sacevelr and sacfilt to handle
			freqlimits
		PPK

	In the headers
		USER1 = low cut corner
		USER2 = high cut corner for any filter operation, e.g.,
			LP BP HP (reject is a problem) TRANSFER
			This is for use with other programs, such as
			sacmft96 sacpom96 

		ROTATE - make this smarter than SAC - actually cut and
			synchronize internally and also rename output
			KCMPNM to either replace Nn by R Ee by T,
			or Az Az + 90, and change the name fo the
			output file accordingly

	1300: - more fixes == if we reread then we should reset the plot
		limits if the default was -- done
	1400: last stretch for 11 hours - cut almost done just need logic
		to fill the data array, e.g., &(*data)[0] ??

-----
18 MAY 2004
	ROT and CUT done - however if we do a read, we must reset the
	write for the default output otherwise we remember the previous
	write arguments

	NOTE if the epoch times are way off - do not plot absolute time
	since we will actually plot 10**11 sec or so

	Keith wanted a DELETE which was too hard to implement because I do
	not used linked lists for the trace data structures but rather an
	array. The idea here is not to use this trace for anything else even
	for output - this is roughed in - must be applied to all
	for(k) loops
	
	Chuck - wanted LOCK/UNLOCK pair - for example read in a trace twice
	LOCK the first, now filter, then the PLOT1 will show the
	original and filtered trace - we can do this with SAC2000 by
	read filter, write, reread

------

20 MAY 2004
	change gsac_plotsp to plot in sort order
	or perhaps the color mapping is not by the sort order - the display
	seems to be by sort order

	OK for trans test to see if the files exists - if it does not
	then set do_tr = NO

-----

22 MAY 2004  - more work on transfer - yuck with builtin
	NOTE CHECK ALL ISARGR ISARGI GETARGR GETARGI for correct return

-----
23 MAY 2004 - transfer done for the time being -- now to work on PLOTPK
	also I need a WRITESP AM and WRITESP PH
	For PLOTSP putin a PLOTSP PH

	also start to plan on plot limits

	put FREQLIMITS into SACFILT and SACEVALR

	for FREQLIMITS - beware if the limits extend beyond the NYQUIST

	FOR USER1 and USER2 if there are values, check before writing in
	case these are changed, e.g.,
	permin = max(newpermin,oldpermin)
	permax = min(newpermax,oldpermax)

-----
24 MAY 2004
	PUT IN FILLZ!

	FOR CD use GLOB to EXPAND
	LOGIC KLUDGED FOR IMPLEMENTING CUT IN GSAC_SAC.C  - also force
	reset to zero

25 MAY 2004 - problem with real data if I do a transfer from to vel
	with a last point of WUAZ time series - not if
	I do the dif numerically instead of through FFT

	so why
-----
27 MAY 2004 - CD can I use glob and then do a test if the entry is a
	directory?

	ENOTDIR if chdir = -1, errvalue is set
	#include <errno.h>
	extern int errno;

-----
30 MAY 2004  - ppk going
	L I actually grab the trace point = sac goes from screen cursor
	coordinate - do this

	for ppk but in XX , also setup markall!!

	MARKALL set up but bury header change in a subroutine
-----
31 MAY 2004
	STILL MUST DO XX -- which requires a display of the X pick
		so need a low level widget that show_pick uses too
	NEED NON-UNIFORM SYNTAX  SAC has MARKALL {ON} [OFF]

	IMPLEMENT NON-STANDARD for CUT B B n or CUT B n B
-----
06 JUN 2004 - for many commands, e.g., plot plotpk but in a DEFAULT to reset
	FOR QDP make the increment dependent upon the number of points in
	the plot window.

-----
09 JUN 2004 - Crikvenica -- put in absolute/relative time in prs
	put in a background command concerning byte order.
	E.g., if we are to convert the binary format to native, then
	on first read, it not in native format, read, swap and then
	write out -- else read and carefully rewrite to preserv e the original
	order

	Problem with ray parameter plot - either need more digits or need
	to invoke the scientific

	Changed grphsubc.c in dolnx to at least the correct thing for ray 
	parameter this has to be really thought out, especially in terms of the
	
	Still have to do desacify for ch and the read/write BIG/Little
	
	
---------------------
RECAP 2004 07 12
	DO WARP ON FILTER COEFFICIENTS

-----------------------


2004 07 16

	GSAC does not SET GCARC AT ALL  -- rethink!!
------

2004 07 20
	Corrected gsac_filt (HP LP BP BR) and gsac_trans.c to properly 
	set USER1 and USER2

-----
2004 07 21 - modified funcgen to give a trinangle - also modified hilbert
	for zero frequency

	FIXED  the env gives crap - why
	Add sort ASCEND DESCEND
-----
2004 07 22
		first cut on merge
	some problems with arrays
	becareful of non-equal data test since this may use end of array

	also rething max number of traces in the DOMORE part where
	we redefine max_nume br_traces which should never be made zero

-----
2004 0723
	If I do a rotate and write - a subsequest read cannot read
	Have I lost my memory

	This also occurs with merge that does not distinguish between
	the newly created files and the old read in list

	so rethink

-----
2004 07 25
	Implemented a distinction between the read files and the write files
	This is to permit the following - so that a subsequent read
	get us there

NOTE - potential problems - what will a WH do in this case -
	If I create a new file, e.g., if
	number.otraces != number.itraces then a WH means to write the file?
	Of course it would be stupid to expect to be able to WH for a new file
	if we do not do a W first ---

	Think!!

Also rethink the maxtraces - if properly set in read?

02 AUG 2004
	L works
	However the display of picks for the relative ppk with a time shift
	is wrong?

	Note: to implement the * / just modify the depmax and depmin

	if traces are reread

	kolor = 1000 + 100*(k%ntrc)/ntrc ;

	Done in PCTL - now we should borrow an idea from MATLAB and
	have PCTL OVERLAY WHICH MENAS DO NOT DO AN ERASE?  PCTL ENDPAGE

	
-----

15 AUG 2004 - for the hold we must first check to see if we are in the plot mode
	otherwise we have a problem with graphics

	We are getting too many flags when implementing the hold
	originally we had that plt would do one and only one frame

	This means that we need more discipline 
	For example if you are in PLT mode and get a BG X11 then
	we must FIRST do a PEND

	If we are in a PLT or X11 mode and program stops
	we must do a PEND

	We need a state that graphics initialized for the gsac end
	This is build in as gsac_control.plotinit == YES

	So this is important to set termination correctly

	NAMING SHIFTED AND ADDED TO PSP

	Concerning xlim use mechanisms of  CUT 
	also add two more parameters to the gsac_sac.h header
	either as a double to indicate the absolute times of
	the current window or the corresponding integers
		double tzbegx
		double tzendx - end of xlim window

		in gsac_sac

		tzbegx = tzbeg
		tzendx = tzend

	In xlim
		if default

                tzbegx = tzbeg
                tzendx = tzend

		else
		reset as in cut

		Then in the plot routines use the
		tzbegx instead of tzbeg

------
18 AUG 2004
	Added PAUSE ECHO for DEMO scripts

	FOR XLIM
		Check to see if possible
		sachdr.rhdr[gsac_control.cutint[0]]!= -12345.

		PERHAPS have a flag to see if this is possible for all
		traces in memory
-----
22 AUG 2004
	PRS done for scaling

	REGIONAL and TELESEISMIC
	when go next page or to redraw - do not do a hole reframe
	after implemented.  

-----
TODO

	IMPLEMENT plotpk [REGIONAL | TELESEISMIC ]


	for PRS put in an option for SHOWPICK
	Put in color support for PRS

1. xlim works but be careful of the syntax, e.g.,
        sac permits xlim 0 100 or xlim b b 100 for the more precise
        xlim b 0 b 100

2. Unless you say ylim all or ylim vmin vmax, ylim will autoscale within the
        window, even in plotpk or ppk

3. I modified prs (plot record section) to add extra white space so
        that the traces are not clipped at the axes
        If you wish to look at many traces from different earthquakes, you
        can do a prs relative if you have been careful with the read, e.g.,
        everything is PKP -10 to PKP +100  where PKP is really some Tn header
        value


6. I have prototyped a pctrl that sets lower left corner of plot and
        axis lengths - the purpose is to permit a MATLAB like subplot
        my HOLD command works with the X11 but my logic for the external
        file is still perturbed

7. I am contemplating a few more commands,  flim alim flog alog flin alin
        for controlling the spectral plot - of course the phase spectra must
        always be linear

8	FILTER is documented but not implemented
	CHECK documentation for TRANSFER

------------------------
PRS when I did the 20040804 event - the prs started about 10 sec late - 
this is because 

PRS needs PLMN shading

FIX HOLD

note for DOITROT  xlim a -10 t0 100
	basically does a 100 second window starting at
	begmin for absolute plot and does ok for relative
	sac2000 plots both the same - time and reference odd for absolute
	but relative also outputs the offset

	xlim for p1 absolute with xlim b 40 b 60 messes all up
	p1 relative is ok

XLIM continued - plot nice now put L A etc does not work
	                                     } else {
    ttime = uv*twin + sacdata[pmap[k].k].sachdr.rhdr[H_B]+sacdata[pmap[k].k].tzref;
                                     }
line 354

                                     tp = uv*twin + sacdata[pmap[k].k].sachdr.rhdr[H_B]+sacdata[pmap[k].k].tzref;
                                     }
line 391
P1 XLIM not work for o -40 o 100 e.g., before the befinning of the one trace
so in determining the limits we must also see if it is before the beginning or the end of trace

PERHAPS XLIM IS OK!

2 SEP 2004

reason - I need a way to say do not use the external title. or
not that if the  plot quantity changes to eliminate the current title

OK I have that fixed but what if the do the order
	TITLE title dist and not  dist TITLE title  - in the first case I
	turn off the title

3 SEP 04  - added the shortened recognition ala Keith -- also
	cleaned documentation

	HOWEVER not document for FILTER
	CHECK documentation for TRANSFER

	MERGE now checks KCMPNM KSTNM

-----

06 SEP 2004
	xlim and cut accept the abbreviated SAC sequence of 
		cut 10 20
		cut a t0

	ch accepts the original sac sequence
		ch o gmt 2001 123 11 22 33 444
		which is converted to the internal sequence
		ch ogmt 2001 123 11 22 33 444

		Note that this also works for the calendar date
		ch o cal 2001 03 01  11 22 33 444
		which is converted to the internal sequence
		ch ocal 2001 03 01  11 22 33 444
	bg can be used to set the graphics environment BEFORE the
		first X window is displayed - this can be use
		in place of or to override the PLOTXVIG environment
