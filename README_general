The goal of this package is to measure Rayleigh wave ellipticity from the 
polarization of ambient noise and to invert it to constrain S-wave velocity,
as in Berbellini et al. 2018.

We provide this package to reproduce our results.

It is formed of two main folders:
Measurement: 	Containing the main DOP-E routines to measure ellipticity of Rayleigh waves from ambient noise. 
		We provide one month of data from Concordia station (CCD, Antarctica) in January 2009, already cut
		in chunks of 8162 samples and corrected for the instrument response. See the README in the 
		measurement folder for more details and references

Inversion:	Here we provide two versions of the code:

	Serial: 	To run inversion on a laptop or pc. A single inversion in this particular case takes approx 1 hour time,
			but the computational time increases rapidly if a more complex parameterisation for the crust is used, 
			i.e. with more layers.

	Parallel:	The parallel version of the code. Very similar to the serial version, it can run on clusters. In our case
			we always run this version using 20 cpu. In this case an inversion takes approx 15 minutes for 4500 models.
